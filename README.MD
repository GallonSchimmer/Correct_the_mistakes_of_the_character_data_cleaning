## Problem Statement

Character recognition software is crucial for digitizing printed texts to allow for editing, searching, and storing on a computer. However, especially with older documents that were originally typed using typewriters, these softwares often misinterpret certain characters:
- 'S' is misinterpreted as '5'
- 'O' is misinterpreted as '0'
- 'I' is misinterpreted as '1'

The challenge is to correct these errors in the digitized text to ensure the integrity of the data being processed.

## Solution Concept

This problem is primarily about **Error Correction** which is crucial in data preprocessing to ensure the integrity of data. The solution requires mapping incorrect entries to their correct form using simple replacement operations based on specific conditions. This is a fundamental problem in **data cleaning** which is essential for preparing raw data for further processing.

## Learning Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Learn how to process and clean data, ensuring that it is correct and useful for further analysis.
- **Character Mapping**: Utilize mapping techniques to replace incorrect characters with correct ones.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implement conditional logic to detect and correct errors.

## Practical Applications

The concepts learned here can be applied in:

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems** to improve the accuracy of digitizing printed materials.
- **Data preprocessing** in Machine Learning and Data Analysis to clean data before it is used in models.
- **Form validation** in software development to ensure that inputs conform to expected formats.

## Algorithm Details

1. **Input Processing**: Convert all characters of the input string to lower or upper case to ensure uniformity.
2. **Replacement Logic**: Check each character against known errors and replace it with the correct character.
3. **Output Generation**: Return the corrected string which has transformed all mistaken characters to their intended form.
